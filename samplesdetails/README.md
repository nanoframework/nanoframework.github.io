# Welcome to the **nanoFramework** team code samples repository

You will find samples documentation and links to the samples projects. You can look at the details here and also you can clone the [nanoFramework Samples repository](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples).

> [!Note]
> sometimes it's convenient to reference the source code instead of the NuGet packages in projects that require debugging by following the execution flow into other projects or even class libraries. For that we recommend using a very handy Visual Studio extension that allows NuGet assembly references to project references switching. That's [NuGet Reference Switcher](https://github.com/rsuter/NuGetReferenceSwitcher).

If you are looking for Iot.Device samples, they are all in the [Iot.Device repository](https://github.com/nanoFramework/nanoFramework.IoT.Device).

## Sample by category

Our samples uses 🌶️ to show how easy or complicated those samples are. The samples with 🌶️ are easy and recommended for beginners. The ones with 🌶️🌶️🌶️ are more advanced and requires some knowledge. This knowledge may not be on .NET nanoFramework but on some other elements like certificates or networking for example.
