<h2 id="about-this-document">About this document</h2>
<p>This document provides guidelines for maintainers on how to interact with the community.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>.NET <strong>nanoFramework</strong> it's an Open Source project therefore it aims to gather the interest of a community as broad as possible. This community is expected to be as active as possible in various fronts: providing feedback, generate discussions around issues and suggestions, contribute back to the project with code and performing various tasks like answering questions in project forums, repo maintenance, project web site, writing documentation, social marketing and others.
The interaction between the project team and the community plays an important role on the overall success of .NET <strong>nanoFramework</strong>. The following guidelines are provided as a suggestion and should also be considered as a &quot;kind of&quot; <strong>S</strong>ervice <strong>L</strong>evel <strong>A</strong>greement for maintainers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always interact with community members in a friendly, courteous and positive way. Remember: people come here probably because they have questions or are in search for help. If they are treated correctly they'll be happy, feel welcome and the are more likely to contribute back, provide a positive feedback or spread the word about .NET <strong>nanoFramework</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If someone is not using the proper channel, not providing enough details to formulate a clear question or not writing clearly, do your best to point them in the right direction and try to understand them. They may not have understood the project instructions properly or they might not be English native. Be patient and understandable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People tend to expect a quick reply to their questions or interactions. Being able to accomplish this not only makes them to have a positive feeling about the project but it also shows that the project is alive and kicking! The person(s) in charge of each channel should be able to provide feedback in a timely fashion. If someone from the team notices that this is not happening (for some reason) it should step in and do it by itself. Note that the feedback here depends on the channel. If it's the Discord channel a dialog has to be established. If it's an issue or a PR just by setting the appropriate labels and assigning it to the person in charge, it's a sign that something is happening and the user will be rest assured that it's being taken care of.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pull request should be always welcomed. Even if they are small or almost meaningless. It helps setting a positive feeling about this and will bring more and with increased quality. When commenting or reviewing keep the positive and friendly tone. Use thanks and please all the time. If a PR is complete trash, not relevant or makes no sense at all try to put it as nicely as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
