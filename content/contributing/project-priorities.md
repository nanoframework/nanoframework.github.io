# Project priorities

We're working hard to have a wide support of targets and platforms, a proper way of building them, deploying their firmware images and, of course, documentation. We have our Discord channel where our top priority is to help each other, answer questions and engage in productive conversations. So [join us on Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/gCyBu8T)!

Any help it's highly appreciated, we ‚ù§Ô∏è **P**ull **R**equests! Keep them coming. üòâ
