## Build options for CMake Presets

Below is a list of the build options available (last updated October 2022) for target boards.
***Note:*** some of these options are specific to the `RTOS` or target type.

- "BUILD_VERSION" : "**version-number-for-the-build-format-is-N.N.N.N**"
  - This can be used [to prevent a board from updating if working on a custom firmware](../faq/automatic-firmware-updates.md#how-to-prevent-a-board-from-updating-if-working-on-a-custom-firmware)
  - This can be used to workaround "[Found assemblies mismatches when checking for deployment pre-check](build-instructions.md#build_version-matching)" error during deployment.
