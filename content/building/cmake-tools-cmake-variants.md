# CMake variants for CMake tools

## About this document

This document describes how to use and modify the **cmake-variants.TEMPLATE.json** file to suit your needs.

_Note : the current revision of the document only focuses on using ChibiOS RTOS. Other RTOSes will follow in a future revision._

## What is it

cmake-variants.TEMPLATE.json is a template containing a minimal set of configuration examples needed to build nanoFramework for you board.

Its content describes what kind of build you will get, which toolchain(s) you will use, which type of MCU is on the board, and some other options that will be described later in this document.

## How to use it

First, you have to either rename the file or copy the contents to **cmake-variants.json**. Then, you will have to modify the content to match your environment.

Later, when you change something in the **cmake-variants.json** you have to close and reopen VS Code and also wipe the build folder, then start again.

## Brief description

There are two sets of parameters that need to be present in this file:

- the build type : 'debug' or 'release', for example
- the board's environment : MCU, toolchain, RTOS

You should not have to modify the *BuildType* section unless you have good reasons to do so. However, the *Linkage* section is the one you will have to take care of.

For each *board* you want to build, you will have to create a dedicated section in the *Linkage* area, precisely describing the MCU, the toolchain, the build type and the RTOS you will use.

## Content explained

The following explains each line of the *linkage* section. Text highlighted in **bold** is an information that you will have to provide.

**_Note : Mind the forward slash ('/') in paths strings !_**

- "**OPTION1_NAME_HERE**"
  - Replace this text with a distinctive option name. e.g. *"STM32F429_Disco"*
- "short": "**summary-here**"
  - Replace the *summary-here* text with one word describing shortly your board. e.g. "F429Disco"
- "long": "**description-here**"
  - This is a more complete description of the configuration
- "BUILD_VERSION" : "**version-number-for-the-build-format-is-N.N.N.N**"
  - This can be used [to prevent a board from updating if working on a custom firmware](../faq/automatic-firmware-updates.md#how-to-prevent-a-board-from-updating-if-working-on-a-custom-firmware)
  - This can be used to workaround "[Found assemblies mismatches when checking for deployment pre-check](build-instructions.md#build_version-matching)" error during deployment.
- "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE" : "**CMake/toolchain.arm-none-eabi-OR-xtensa-esp32-elf.cmake**"
  - This is the toolchain file for the target being built. Currently there we support GNU GCC and Xtensa for ESP32.
- "TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX" : "**absolute-to-gcc-toolchain-mind-the-forward-slash**"
  - This is the path to your gcc toolchain compiler. Use forward slashes and do not provide executable name here
- "TOOL_HEX2DFU_PREFIX" : "**absolute-path-to-hex2dfu-utility-mind-the-forward-slash**"
  - This is the path to the HEX2DFU utility. Use forward slashes and do not provide executable name here.
- "ESP32_IDF_PATH" : "**absolute-path-to-esp-idf-mind-the-forward-slash**"
  - This the path to the ESP32 IDF utility. Use forward slashes and do not provide executable name here.
- "ESP32_LIBS_PATH" : "**absolute-path-to-the-ESP32-libs-folder-mind-the-forward-slashes**"
  - This is the path to the folder where the ESP32 libraries can be found. Use forward slashes.
- "EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH" : "**${workspaceRoot}/build**"
  - This is the default and recommended path which will expand to the build folder when building from VS Code. When building from the command line or from Visual Studio this is not required.
- "TARGET_SERIES" : "**STM32F7xx**"
  - For STM32 MCUs represents the target series (STM32F4XX, STM32L4XX, and so on)
  -For ESP32 matches the target name: "ESP32_WROOM_32"
- "USE_RNG" : "**ON**"
  - Option to enable the use of the hardware true random generator unit, if present. Default is ON as the majority of the targets have this feature.
- "DP_FLOATINGPOINT" : "**OFF**"
  - Enables support for double-precision floating point. The default is single-precision. Set to ON to enable double precision floating point.
- "SUPPORT_ANY_BASE_CONVERSION" : "**OFF**"
  - Defines which bases are supported when performing string to value conversions. When ON support for any base is enabled. When OFF (the default) the image will be compiled with support for base 10 and base 16 only.
- "RTOS" : "**one-of-valid-rtos-options**"
  - Defines the RTOS that will be used to build nanoFramework. It can be CHIBIOS or FREERTOS_ESP32. Currently ChibiOS is supported for all STM32 targets and FreeRTOS is supported for ESP32 targets.
- "RTOS_SOURCE_FOLDER" : "**absolute-path-to-chosen-rtos-source-mind-the-forward-slash**"
  - Path to an optional local installation of an RTOS e.g. ChibiOS source files. If no path is given, then CMake will download the sources automatically from the RTOS repository when required.
- "CHIBIOS_BOARD" : "**valid-chibios-board-name-from-boards-collection**"
  - Name of your board, chosen from the available boards collection that can be found in the \os\hal\boards folder of the ChibiOS installation (or distant repository)
- "SWO_OUTPUT" : "**OFF**"
  - Allows specifying whether to include, or not, support for Cortex-M Single Wire Output (SWO). Default is OFF. Check the documentation [here](../contributing/developing-native/arm-swo.md) for more details on how to use SWO.
- "NF_BUILD_RTM" : "**OFF**"
  - Sets if the build is of **R**eady **T**o **M**arket type. Meaning that all debug helpers and code blocks will be removed from compilation and the build will be compiled and linked with all possible code reducing options enabled.

More information about this is available in the documentation [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cxk374d9(v=vs.90).aspx). ***Note that the complete removal of support for this feature is being considered (see issue [here](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter/issues/303)).***
- "NF_FEATURE_WATCHDOG" : "**ON**"
  - Allows you to define it the hardware watchdog should be disabled.
   This setting can only be set to OFF for STM32 targets. ESP32 build enables this by default so there is no way to disable it.
   Default is ON, so the hardware watchdog will be enabled by default.
- "NF_FEATURE_HAS_CONFIG_BLOCK" : "**OFF**"

  "oneWordSummary$": "QUAIL",
        "description$": "MBN Quail",
        "settings":
  {
            "TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX" : "C:/Program Files (x86)/GNU Tools ARM Embedded/5.4 2016q3",

   "NF_FEATURE_DEBUGGER" : "TRUE",
            "NF_FEATURE_RTC" : "ON",
   "NF_FEATURE_USE_APPDOMAINS" : "OFF",
   "NF_FEATURE_USE_NETWORKING" : "OFF",
