<p>⚠️ NOTE about the need to build .NET <strong>nanoFramework</strong> firmware ⚠️</p>
<p>You only need to build it if you plan to debug the native code, add new targets or add new features at native level.
If your goal is to code in C# you just have to flash your MCU with the appropriate firmware image.
There are available ready to flash firmware images for several targets, please check the <a href="https://github.com/nanoframework/Home#firmware-for-reference-boards">Home</a> repository.</p>
<h2 id="developing-firmware-for-the-nanoframework-using-visual-studio-2019-community-edition">Developing firmware for the nanoframework using Visual Studio 2019 community edition</h2>
<p><a href="#developing-firmware-for-the-nanoframework-using-visual-studio-2017-community-edition">(See below for VS2017)</a></p>
<p>The development process described below for VS2017 was initially focused on the STM32/ChibiOS target, with the Espressif ESP32 added later. In this update we will use the ESP32 as our example, for STM32 specific information refer to the VS2017 section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very long file names used in the ChibiOS builds can result in exceeding the Windows 250 character path limit. Sometimes CMake will complain about this, or you may get seemingly random failed builds. The previous workaround for this was to place your source in a top-level directory. As an alternative we have been using the Windows <code>SUBST</code> command to access the source via ashorted drive mapped path. There are some tools provided to automate this process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="first-set-up-a-working-build-environment-with-vs-code-recommended">First set up a working build environment with VS Code (Recommended)</h3>
<p>While it is possible to set up a successful build and debug environment using VS 2019, setting up the VS Code environment first is highly recommended. This is the most used and tested path, and should you run into any obstacles along the way you will most likely be able to get assistance from other users. Once that is up and running, you can switch to your preferred IDE!</p>
<p>Follow along with one of the guides here:</p>

<h3 id="install-visual-studio-2019-community-and-workloads">Install Visual Studio 2019 Community and workloads</h3>
<p>You should now have the pieces in place to build, deploy and debug the nanoFramework interpreter, and you may have already installed Visual Studio and tried running some of the managed code examples. We now need to hook these pieces up with Visual Studio so we can use it to run the build/deploy/debug process.</p>

<h3 id="configuration-files">Configuration Files</h3>
<p>VS Code and VS2019/2017 keep the majority of their configuration files in <code>&quot;hidden&quot;</code> directories (in the sense that Unix/Linux hides directory names beginning with a period). For VS Code this is named <code>&quot;.vscode&quot;</code> and for VS2019 it is named <code>&quot;.vs&quot;</code>, which helps to keep them from treading on each others toes.
The VS2019 IDE normally hides the contents of this directory in <code>Solution Explorer</code>, but if you go to the task-bar at the top of the <code>Solution Explorer</code> pane and hover over the icons you will find <code>Show All Files</code>. When selected, these files appear below in <code>&quot;Local Settings (.vs)&quot;</code></p>
<p>The two configuration files in <code>.vs</code> are <code>tasks.vs.json</code> and <code>launch.vs.json</code>. When you clone the <code>nf-interpreter</code> repository there will be two files names <code>tasks.vs.SAMPLE.json</code> and <code>launch.vs.SAMPLE.json</code>, which you can copy as the appropriate name and then modify to suit your configuration if required. Note that these are <code>SAMPLE</code> rather than <code>TEMPLATE</code> files as they are not used as a basis for automatic configuration, but are there as an example of something that is known to work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike VS2017, VS2019 currently rewrites your JSON configuration files,and in doing so will remove any comments you have added. This may strictly follow the JSON spec., but for human readable configuration files is a <strong>Really Bad Thing!</strong> Hopefully MS will realize this and change the behaviour, perhaps taking on a more reasoned format such as <a href="https://json5.org/">JSON5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="tasksvsjson">tasks.vs.json</h4>
<p>This adds some entries to the Right-Click context menu for items in the <code>Solution Explorer</code> pane, for example <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>. The sample file is set up for the ESP32, and uses <code>esptool.py</code> to erase or program Flash on the device. You may need to modify the <code>&quot;port&quot;</code> setting near the top of the file from <code>COM3</code> to the port your ESP32 is connected to.</p>
<h4 id="launchvsjson">launch.vs.json</h4>
<p>This is used to launch the debugger, using <code>GDB</code> locally with <code>OpenOCD</code> acting as the GDB server providing a connection to your device. The example for ESP32 is using a <code>SEGGER JLINK</code> device to connect to the ESP32 JTAG pins, while the STM32 example uses the <code>STM32 STLINK</code> interface on the STM769IDiscovery board.</p>
<p>Note that we haven't been able to get the debug system working purely using the  VS2019 resources, and we call a Windows batch file <code>&quot;startocd.bat&quot;</code> to handle the <code>OpenOCD</code> configuration details. Take a look at that file and modify it to suit your configuration. (It <strong>can</strong> have comments as VS doesn't mess with it!) When you have something that works please let us know and we can add it as another option to the file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GDB requires <code>/</code> separators in the path passed for the executable file and symbols, rather than the windows backslash <code>\</code>, and at present neither VS Code or VS2017/2019 can do that for us when expanding variables, hence the need to add a hard-coded file path. For VS Code we have a neat little extension <code>nf</code> to take care of that for us, but at this stage no such solution for VS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="cmakesettingsjson">CMakeSettings.json</h4>
<p>This is the main configuration file for setting build options for the <code>nf-interpreter</code>, and is located in the root directory. Currently the repository has the actual file rather than a <code>SAMPLE</code> version, something we need to review as we don't want updates overwriting your local modifications!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may prefer to work from a local branch that keeps your changes safe, rather than the <code>develop</code> branch. I currently use a branch <code>SaveLocalSettings</code> to build,with a small script that automatically pulls and merges upstream <code>develop</code> changes into it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that VS2019 will walk all over this file! But on the up-side it does give you a nice GUI interface for changing the options included in your build and generating the system, something not present in VS2017. To access this Right-Click on <code>CMakeSettings.json</code> in <code>Solution Explorer</code>, and select the option <code>&quot;CMake Settings for nanoFramework&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="helper-batch-scripts">Helper Batch Scripts</h3>
<h4 id="runcmdbat">RunCmd.bat</h4>
<p>Helper script to run a command in a separate console window, with a timeout after the command completes before closing the window. This was required when programming ESP32 boards requiring manual intervention (button press). <code>Esptool.py</code> sends a sequence of <code>___...___...___...</code> during which you may need to hold the boot button and press reset, however VS2019 buffers the output window so you don't see this until it is too late.
First parameter <code>n</code> is timeout in seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>n = 0 - wait for user input after command completes</li>
<li>n &gt; 0 - wait for n seconds after command completes</li>
<li>N &lt; 0 - wait only if command completed with error</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="setnfrootbat">SetNFRoot.bat</h4>
<p>This script is used to help overcome the problem of file paths exceeding the Windows 250 character limit when building <code>nf-interpreter</code>. It does this by usingthe Windows <code>SUBST</code> command to map an unused drive letter to the source root directory. If a mapping already exists, it will be re-used. The environment variable <code>nfRoot</code> is set to this location, which can be accessed from within Visual Studio.</p>
<p>For example, if my source root is located at <code>D:\usr_chronos\Sandbox\NanoFramework\nf-interpreter\</code></p>
<pre><code class="lang-batch">D:\usr_chronos\Sandbox\NanoFramework\nf-interpreter&gt;SetNFRoot.bat
Found free drive letter: B:
Created new  subst for D:\usr_chronos\Sandbox\NanoFramework\nf-interpreter\ on B:
You can remove it with subst B: /D
Using short path B:\ for D:\usr_chronos\Sandbox\NanoFramework\nf-interpreter\
B:\
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can refer to the source root as <code>B:\</code> and build from there, giving as a substantially shorter path.</p>
<p>The script output (see above) is sent to <code>stderr</code> rather than <code>stdout</code>, except for the final <code>B:\</code>, meaning it can be used as a command variable expansion in VS, as well as an environment variable expansion, ie <code>${env.nfRoot}</code> or <code>${cmd.SetNFRoot.bat}</code></p>
<h4 id="startocdbat">startocd.bat</h4>
<p>This script is called by <code>GDB</code> to start <code>OpenOCD</code> as a separate process, you can add additional entries to the bottom of the script following the existing pattern. The label is passed from a line in <code>launch.vs.json</code>, default is for ESP32 with J-Link.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The script currently starts <code>C:/nanoFramework_Tools/Tools/openocd/bin/openocd.exe</code> for the <code>STM32_STLINK</code> label, which is what you will have installed if you followed the STM32 instructions, but I've actually had better results using the ESP32 version of OpenOCD with the STM32.
If you have that version installed just comment out the line following the <code>:STM32_STLINK</code> label.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="build-locations">Build Locations</h3>
<p>We are able to build in separate locations to suit the target type and configuration we are working on. The current layout is to use the <code>Build</code> subdirectory to contain all the separate build types folders, so <code>Build\ESP32</code> for ESP32 vanilla build, <code>Build\ESP32_test</code> for a test build, etc.
The STM32 builds are most likely to require a shortened build path, so we can use  <code>&quot;${env.nfRoot}Build/${name}&quot;</code> in our <code>CMakeSettings.json</code> file STM769IDiscovery section. The build will then be done in <code>&quot;B:\Build\STM769IDiscovery&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>Once the program has been built and loaded into flash, you can launch the debugger. You need to select the launch configuration from the dropdown, as shown:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/getting-started/VS2019Toolbars.png" alt="VS2019 toolbar"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the launch configuration, here  <code>ESP32 nanoCLR - Segger JLink</code>, may not show up for selection in the dropdown immediately, in some cases it takes some minutes to be available. We assume VS2019 is doing something in the background, if anyone knows the cause or a way to speed this up please let us know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can then commence debugging from the top DEBUG menu.</p>
<p>OpenOCD should open in its own console window, connect to the target device, and display something similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/getting-started/OpenOCDConsole.png" alt="Open ODCconsole"></p>
<p>In the VS2019 IDE output Window you should see:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Note: It is sometimes necessary to delete the contents of these folders if Visual Studio misbehaves.
Using Visual Studio with CMake results in what appears to be inconsistencies at times.
Sometime the CMake server goes away, shutting down Visual Studio and restarting usually fixes the problem.</li>
<li>Note: After clearing the CMake cache, on occasions the build/chibios_source directory is left empty or only containing the .git file
due to some conflict. The current CMakeLists.txt file finds the directory and does not re-copy the code.

the VSCODE version and some options do not appear to work properly.
Also, the whole system is a bit flakey. The openocd program is run as sub process of Visual Studio,and if it runs into problems the
system fails, and you must run up task manager to end the openocd.exe task listed as a process of Visual Studio.</p>
<h4 id="diagnosing-problems-with-the-debug-and-launchvsjson">Diagnosing problems with the debug and launch.vs.json</h4>
<p>You can get a better understanding of problems that may be occuring with the gdb/openocd debug setup.
In Visual Studio select the Command Window Ctrl+Alt+A, and turn on debug logging with the following command.</p>
<p><code>debug.midebuglog /On:c:\Temp\debug.log</code></p>
<p>Run a debugging session to collect data and turn it off with the following command.</p>
<p><code>debug.midebuglog /Off</code></p>
<p>This will give you a log of the operation and communications occuring. ( Good luck!)</p>
