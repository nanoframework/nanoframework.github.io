# Getting started with .NET **nanoFramework**

We have several getting started guides to help you start with .NET **nanoFramework**.

⚠️ NOTE about the need to build .NET **nanoFramework** firmware ⚠️

You only need to build it if you plan to debug the native code, add new targets or add new features at native level.
If your goal is to code in C# you just have to flash your MCU with the appropriate firmware image.
There are available ready to flash firmware images for several targets, please check the [reference targets](../reference-targets/index.md) and several others [community contributed](../community-targets/index.md).
