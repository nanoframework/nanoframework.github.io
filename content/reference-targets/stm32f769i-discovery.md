## Connecting and powering the board

There are two USB ports on the board. For firmware flashing and debugging, use the one named "USB ST_LINK":

>Note: This USB connection will also power the board. Alternatively, it supports PoE, so it may be handy when deploying in the field (although you will not be able to upload new program that way). To enable PoE, install an appropriate jumper on CN3 header.

## Installing drivers and STM32 Cube Programmer

Download the appropriate [STM32 Cube Programmer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) version from ST web site and install it in your development machine. (it will also install USB drivers)

## Flashing initial nanoFramework firmware

Before you can code in C#, nanoFramework runtime has to be flashed in. This is done by `nanoff` utility, which you installed in the Getting Started guide. Run this command in the Command Prompt:

`nanoff --target ST_STM32F769I_DISCOVERY --update`

This command will download the latest stable FW revision, detect the the board and flash it.

If it complains like this, disregard it:

You are now ready to upload C# programs.

## User LEDs and buttons

The are four LEDs available for the user, marked LD1-LD4, and also a button USER. Their pins are:

|Marking|MCU port&pin|nF pin number|
|---|---|---|
|LD1|PJ13|157|
|LD2|PJ5|149|
|LD3|PA12|12|
|LD4|PD4|52|
|USER|PA0|0|

**Note**: LD4 levels are inverted compared to LD1-LD3.

**Note**: LD3 is also tied to the Arduino header pin D13.

If you want to know, how MCU pin name is converted to nF pin number, [see the FAQ here](https://docs.nanoframework.net/content/faq/working-with-stm32-targets.html).
