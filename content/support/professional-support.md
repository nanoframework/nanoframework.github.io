Aimed at commercial users developing .NET **nanoFramework** based projects has the objective to help them reduce their development effort and, consequently, the time to market. The support services ensure that:

- Your questions will be answered correctly and in a timely fashion.
- Bugs that you report are fixed with higher priority.

To have access to this, you're expected to make a monetary contribution to the project. Which will not only pay for the time consumed in the support task but will also, obviously, contribute to the project continuous growth.
