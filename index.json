Edit and continue enables you to make changes to your source code while your program is in break mode. The ability to edit and continue is compiler dependent. IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints Use the implicit MSIL sequence points, not the program database (PDB) sequence points. The symbolic information normally includes at least one Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) offset for each source line. When the just-in-time (JIT) compiler is about to compile a method, it asks the profiling services for a list of MSIL offsets that should be preserved. These MSIL offsets are called sequence points. None Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, JIT tracking information is always generated, and this flag has the same effect as Default, except that it sets the DebuggableAttribute.IsJITTrackingEnabled property to false. However, because JIT tracking is always enabled, the property value is ignored in version 2.0 or later. Note that, unlike the None flag, the None flag cannot be used to disable JIT optimizations."

    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide nanoFramework enables the writing of managed code applications for embedded devices. Doesn't matter if you are a seasoned .NET developer or if you've just arrived here and want to give it a try. This getting started guide will walk you through the setup of your development machine to get you coding a nice \"Hello World\" in no time! You can find the video for this guide on our YouTube channel here . The hardware In this guide we'll be using a ST Microelectronics STM32F746 NUCLEO board. This is a rather common and inexpensive board that packs a Cortex M7 with 1MB flash, 320 kB of RAM and includes an ethernet connector. Installing Visual Studio 2017 The first part is to get Visual Studio 2017 and the nanoFramework extension installed. Download Visual Studio 2017. If you already have it installed, you can skip this step. If you don't, please download the free Visual Studio Community 2017 edition. Either way, make sure you've selected the .NET desktop workload. Launch Visual Studio 2017 (we'll just refer to it as VS from now on) and install the nanoFramework extension. You can do this by going into Tools > Extensions and Updates. Make sure you've switched the left-hand tree view to the Online branch and enter nanoFramework in the search box. Now open the Device Explorer window. You can do this by going into View > Other Windows > Device Explorer. Uploading the firmware to the board The second part is to load the nanoFramework image in the board flash. Actually there are two images, one for nanoBooter and another one for nanoCLR. Download the STM32 ST-LINK Utility from ST web site and install it in your development machine. Download a ZIP file with the firmware for the board from our web site here by clicking on the appropriate badge. This will take you to our JFrog Bintray repository that holds the packages with pre-build images for several target boards. After downloading it, unzip the package contents. Connect the STM32F746 NUCLEO board to your PC using an USB cable. In fact, you'll be needing two USB cables with a micro USB connector. One to connect to the ST-Link debugger, that doubles as power supply to the board. And a second one to connect the USB client of the board. Launch the ST-LINK Utility that you've just installed and connect to the STM32F746 NUCLEO board. Perform a \"full chip erase\" to clear the flash. Load the nanoBooter.hex file from the package and hit the \"Program and verify\" button. Make sure you tick the \"Reset after programming\" check box and hit \"Start\". After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoBooter image runs. You can check the success of the operation watching for a slow blink pattern on the LED. Congratulations, you now have a board running nanoFramework's booter! Next, load the nanoCLR.hex file from the extracted package folder and hit again the \"Program and verify\" button. Make sure you tick the \"Reset after programming\" check box and hit \"Start\". After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoCLR image will run. This time and if all goes as expected, there will be no LED blinking. You can check if the board is properly running nanoFramework by looking into the Device Explorer window in VS. Coding a 'Hello World' application Now you have everything that you need to start coding your first application. Let's go for a good old 'Hello World' in micro-controller mode, which is blinking a LED, shall we? Go back to VS and click File > New > Project. Make sure you have selected 'Framework 4.6 or above' and choose nanoFramework, on the left hand side tree view. Choose the 'Blank Application' template and a location of your choosing were the project files will be saved. Name your project and hit OK. The program file will be automatically opened for you. We'll code a very simple application that enters an infinite loop and turns on and off an LED. We'll skip the details because that's not the aim of this guide. Let's just grab the code from the nanoFramework samples repo here . Make sure that the correct GPIO pin is being used. That's the line below the comment mentioning the STM32F746 NUCLEO board. Because GPIO is being used we need to pull that class library and a reference to it in our project. The class libraries are distributed through NuGet. To add this class, right click on 'References' in the Solution Explorer and click 'Manage NuGet Packages'. On the search box type 'nanoFramework'. Make sure you have the preview checkbox ticked. Find the Windows.Devices.Gpio package and click \"Install\". After the license confirmation box, the package will be downloaded and a reference to it will be added. You'll notice that you no longer have the unknown references hints in VS. Click \"Build Solution\" from the Build menu. A success message shows in the Build window. We are almost there. Go into the Device Explorer window and click on the nanoFramework device showing there. Make sure the connection is OK by hitting the \"Ping\" button. On success, a message shows on the output window. Let's deploy the application to the board. In order to do that, right click on the Project name and choose \"Deploy\". You'll see the feedback of the several operations that are running on the background in the Output Window. After a successful deployment, your 'Hello World' blinky application will start running and, voilá , the LED starts blinking! Wrapping up Congratulations! That's your first nanoFramework C# application executing right there on the target board. How awesome is that?! And this is it for the getting started guide. You've went through the steps required to install Visual Studio, the nanoFramework extension and the ST-LINK Utility. You've also learned how to upload nanoFramework firmware images into a target board. And last, but not the least: how to code a simple 'Hello World' C# application and deploy it to a target board. Check out other guides and tutorials. You may also want to join our Slack workspace , where you'll find a supportive community to discuss your ideas and help you in case you get stuck on something."

The SocketType enumeration provides several options for defining the type of Socket that you intend to open. Fields Name Description Dgram Supports datagrams, which are connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed (typically small) maximum length. Messages might be lost or duplicated and might arrive out of order. A Socket of type Dgram requires no connection prior to sending and receiving data, and can communicate with multiple peers. Dgram uses the Datagram Protocol (Udp) and the InterNetworkAddressFamily. Raw Supports access to the underlying transport protocol. Using the SocketTypeRaw, you can communicate using protocols like Internet Control Message Protocol (Icmp) and Internet Group Management Protocol (Igmp). Your application must provide a complete IP header when sending. Received datagrams return with the IP header and options intact. Rdm Supports connectionless, message-oriented, reliably delivered messages, and preserves message boundaries in data. Rdm (Reliably Delivered Messages) messages arrive unduplicated and in order. Furthermore, the sender is notified if messages are lost. If you initialize a Socket using Rdm, you do not require a remote host connection before sending and receiving data. With Rdm, you can communicate with multiple peers. Seqpacket Provides connection-oriented and reliable two-way transfer of ordered byte streams across a network. Seqpacket does not duplicate data, and it preserves boundaries within the data stream. A Socket of type Seqpacket communicates with a single peer and requires a remote host connection before communication can begin. Stream Supports reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams without the duplication of data and without preservation of boundaries. A Socket of this type communicates with a single peer and requires a remote host connection before communication can begin.

You must cast this EndPoint to an IPEndPoint before retrieving any information. You can then call the Address method to retrieve the local IPAddress , and the Port method to retrieve the local port number. The LocalEndPoint property is usually set after you make a call to the Bind(EndPoint) method. If you allow the system to assign your socket's local IP address and port number, the LocalEndPoint property will be set after the first I/O operation.

If you are using a connectionless protocol, RemoteEndPoint contains the default remote IP address and port number with which the Socket will communicate. You must cast this EndPoint to an IPEndPoint before retrieving any information. You can then call the Address method to retrieve the remote IPAddress , and the Port method to retrieve the remote port number. The RemoteEndPoint is set after a call to either Accept() or Connect(EndPoint) . If you try to access this property earlier, RemoteEndPoint will throw a SocketException .

If the time-out period is exceeded, the Send(Byte[]) method will throw a SocketException . Methods | Improve this Doc View Source Accept() Creates a new Socket for a newly created connection. Declaration public Socket Accept() Returns Type Description Socket A Socket for a newly created connection. Remarks Accept synchronously extracts the first pending connection request from the connection request queue of the listening socket, and then creates and returns a new Socket . You cannot use this returned Socket to accept any additional connections from the connection queue. However, you can call the RemoteEndPoint method of the returned Socket to identify the remote host's network address and port number. Before calling the Accept method, you must first call the Listen method to listen for and queue incoming connection requests. | Improve this Doc View Source Bind(EndPoint) Associates a Socket with a local endpoint. Declaration public void Bind(EndPoint localEP) Parameters Type Name Description EndPoint localEP The local EndPoint to associate with the Socket . Remarks Use the Bind method if you need to use a specific local endpoint. You must call Bind before you can call the Listen(Int32) method. You do not need to call Bind before using the Connect(EndPoint) method unless you need to use a specific local endpoint. You can use the Bind method on both connectionless and connection-oriented protocols. Before calling Bind, you must first create the local IPEndPoint from which you intend to communicate data. If you do not care which local address is assigned, you can create an IPEndPoint using Any as the address parameter, and the underlying service provider will assign the most appropriate network address. This might help simplify your application if you have multiple network interfaces. If you do not care which local port is used, you can create an IPEndPoint using 0 for the port number. In this case, the service provider will assign an available port number between 1024 and 5000. If you use the above approach, you can discover what local network address and port number has been assigned by calling the LocalEndPoint . If you are using a connection-oriented protocol, LocalEndPoint will not return the locally assigned network address until after you have made a call to the Connect(EndPoint) method. If you are using a connectionless protocol, you will not have access to this information until you have completed a send or receive. If you intend to receive multicast datagrams, you must call the Bind method with a multicast port number.

Declaration public void Close() Remarks The Close method closes the remote host connection and releases all managed and unmanaged resources associated with the Socket. Upon closing, the Connected property is set to false. | Improve this Doc View Source Connect(EndPoint) Establishes a connection to a remote host. Declaration public void Connect(EndPoint remoteEP) Parameters Type Name Description EndPoint remoteEP An EndPoint that represents the remote device. Remarks If you are using a connection-oriented protocol such as TCP, the Connect method synchronously establishes a network connection between LocalEndPoint and the specified remote endpoint. If you are using a connectionless protocol, Connect establishes a default remote host. After you call Connect, you can send data to the remote device with the Send(Byte[]) method, or receive data from the remote device with the Receive(Byte[]) method. If you are using a connectionless protocol such as UDP, you do not have to call Connect before sending and receiving data. You can use SendTo(Byte[], EndPoint) and ReceiveFrom(Byte[], Int32, Int32, SocketFlags, ref EndPoint) to synchronously communicate with a remote host. If you do call Connect, any datagrams that arrive from an address other than the specified default will be discarded. If you want to set your default remote host to a broadcast address, you must first call the SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName, Boolean) method and set the socket option to Broadcast , or Connect will throw a SocketException. If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code. After you have obtained this code, refer to the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in the MSDN library for a detailed description of the error. If you are using a connection-oriented protocol and did not call Bind before calling Connect, the underlying service provider will assign the local network address and port number. If you are using a connectionless protocol, the service provider will not assign a local network address and port number until you complete a send or receive operation. If you want to change the default remote host, call Connect again with the desired endpoint. | Improve this Doc View Source Dispose(Boolean) Releases the unmanaged resources used by the Socket , and optionally disposes of the managed resources. Declaration protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) Parameters Type Name Description Boolean disposing true to release both managed and unmanaged resources; false to releases only unmanaged resources. Remarks This method is called by the public Dispose() method and the Finalize() method. Dispose() invokes the protected Dispose(Boolean) method with the disposing parameter set to true. Finalize() invokes Dispose with disposing set to false. When the disposing parameter is true, this method releases all resources held by any managed objects that this Socket references. This method invokes the Dispose() method of each referenced object. | Improve this Doc View Source Finalize() Deconstructor Declaration protected void Finalize() | Improve this Doc View Source GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName) Returns the value of a Socket option.

When the optionName parameter is set to Linger the return value is an instance of the LingerOption class. When optionName is set to AddMembership or DropMembership , the return value is an instance of the MulticastOption class. When optionName is any other value, the return value is an integer. Remarks Socket options determine the behavior of the current Socket . Use this overload to get the Linger , AddMembership , and DropMembership options. For the Linger option, use Socket for the optionLevel parameter. For AddMembership and DropMembership , use IP . If you want to set the value of any of the options listed above, use the SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName, Int32) method. | Improve this Doc View Source GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName, Byte[]) Returns the specified Socket option setting, represented as a byte array. Declaration public void GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel optionLevel, SocketOptionName optionName, byte[] val) Parameters Type Name Description SocketOptionLevel optionLevel One of the SocketOptionLevel values. SocketOptionName optionName One of the SocketOptionName values. Byte [] val An array of type Byte that is to receive the option setting. Remarks Socket options determine the behavior of the current Socket . Upon successful completion of this method, the array specified by the val parameter contains the value of the specified Socket option. When the length of the val array is smaller than the number of bytes required to store the value of the specified Socket option, GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName) will throw a SocketException. If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code.

Remarks The Poll method will check the state of the Socket . Specify SelectRead for the selectMode parameter to determine if the Socket is readable. Specify SelectWrite to determine if the Socket is writable. Use SelectError to detect an error condition. Poll will block execution until the specified time period, measured in microseconds, elapses. Set the microSeconds parameter to a negative integer if you would like to wait indefinitely for a response. If you want to check the status of multiple sockets, you might prefer to use the Select method. If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code.

Declaration public int Send(byte[] buffer) Parameters Type Name Description Byte [] buffer An array of type Byte that contains the data to be sent Returns Type Description Int32 The number of bytes sent to the Socket . Remarks Send(Byte[]) synchronously sends data to the remote host specified in the Connect(EndPoint) or Accept() method and returns the number of bytes successfully sent. Send(Byte[]) can be used for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols. This overload requires a buffer that contains the data you want to send. The SocketFlags value defaults to 0, the buffer offset defaults to 0, and the number of bytes to send defaults to the size of the buffer. If you are using a connectionless protocol, you must call Connect(EndPoint) before calling this method, or will throw a SocketException . If you are using a connection-oriented protocol, you must either use Connect(EndPoint) to establish a remote host connection, or use Accept() to accept an incoming connection. If you are using a connectionless protocol and plan to send data to several different hosts, you should use the SendTo(Byte[], EndPoint) method. If you do not use the SendTo method, you will have to call Connect before each call to Send. You can use SendTo even after you have established a default remote host with Connect. You can also change the default remote host prior to calling Send by making another call to Connect. If you are using a connection-oriented protocol, will block until all of the bytes in the buffer are sent, unless a time-out was set by using SendTimeout . If the time-out value was exceeded, the call will throw a SocketException . In nonblocking mode, Send may complete successfully even if it sends less than the number of bytes in the buffer. It is your application's responsibility to keep track of the number of bytes sent and to retry the operation until the application sends the bytes in the buffer. There is also no guarantee that the data you send will appear on the network immediately. To increase network efficiency, the underlying system may delay transmission until a significant amount of outgoing data is collected. A successful completion of the Send(Byte[]) method means that the underlying system has had room to buffer your data for a network send. important If you receive a SocketException, use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code. After you have obtained this code, refer to the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in the MSDN library for a detailed description of the error. important The successful completion of a send does not indicate that the data was successfully delivered. If no buffer space is available within the transport system to hold the data to be transmitted, send will block unless the socket has been placed in nonblocking mode.

Calls the constructor that matches the given arguments. The supplied member name is ignored. If the type of lookup is not specified, (Instance | Public) will apply. It is not possible to call a type initializer. This flag is passed to an InvokeMember method to invoke a constructor. DeclaredOnly Specifies that only members declared at the level of the supplied type's hierarchy should be considered. Inherited members are not considered. Default Specifies that no binding flags are defined. ExactBinding Specifies that types of the supplied arguments must exactly match the types of the corresponding formal parameters. Reflection throws an exception if the caller supplies a non-null Binder object, since that implies that the caller is supplying BindToXXX implementations that will pick the appropriate method.

NonPublic Specifies that non-public members are to be included in the search. OptionalParamBinding Returns the set of members whose parameter count matches the number of supplied arguments. This binding flag is used for methods with parameters that have default values and methods with variable arguments (varargs). This flag should only be used with Type.InvokeMember. Public Specifies that public members are to be included in the search. PutDispProperty Specifies that the PROPPUT member on a COM object should be invoked. PROPPUT specifies a property-setting function that uses a value. Use PutDispProperty if a property has both PROPPUT and PROPPUTREF and you need to distinguish which one is called.
