    "keywords": "Getting Started Guide for managed code (C#) nanoFramework enables the writing of managed code applications for embedded devices. Doesn't matter if you are a seasoned .NET developer or if you've just arrived here and want to give it a try. This getting started guide will walk you through the setup of your development machine to get you coding a nice \"Hello World\" in no time! You can find the video for this guide on our YouTube channel here . The hardware In this guide we'll be using a ST Microelectronics STM32F746 NUCLEO board. This is a rather common and inexpensive board that packs a Cortex M7 with 1MB flash, 320 kB of RAM and includes an ethernet connector. Installing Visual Studio 2017 The first part is to get Visual Studio 2017 and the nanoFramework extension installed. Download Visual Studio 2017. If you already have it installed, you can skip this step. If you don't, please download the free Visual Studio Community 2017 edition. Either way, make sure you've selected the .NET desktop workload. Launch Visual Studio 2017 (we'll just refer to it as VS from now on) and install the nanoFramework extension. You can do this by going into Tools > Extensions and Updates. Make sure you've switched the left-hand tree view to the Online branch and enter nanoFramework in the search box. Now open the Device Explorer window. You can do this by going into View > Other Windows > Device Explorer. Uploading the firmware to the board Using the ST-LINK Utility The second part is to load the nanoFramework image in the board flash. Actually there are two images, one for nanoBooter and another one for nanoCLR. There are two methods to flash the image to the device. This method uses the ST-LINK Utility. The second method using a .dfu file will explored in the next section below. Download the STM32 ST-LINK Utility from ST web site and install it in your development machine. Download a ZIP file with the firmware for the board from our web site here by clicking on the appropriate badge. This will take you to our JFrog Bintray repository that holds the packages with pre-build images for several target boards. After downloading it, unzip the package contents. Connect the STM32F746 NUCLEO board to your PC using an USB cable. In fact, you'll be needing two USB cables with a micro USB connector. One to connect to the ST-Link debugger, that doubles as power supply to the board. And a second one to connect the USB client of the board. Launch the ST-LINK Utility that you've just installed and connect to the STM32F746 NUCLEO board. Perform a \"full chip erase\" to clear the flash. Load the nanoBooter.hex file from the package and hit the \"Program and verify\" button. Make sure you tick the \"Reset after programming\" check box and hit \"Start\". After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoBooter image runs. You can check the success of the operation watching for a slow blink pattern on the LED. Congratulations, you now have a board running nanoFramework's booter! Next, load the nanoCLR.hex file from the extracted package folder and hit again the \"Program and verify\" button. Make sure you tick the \"Reset after programming\" check box and hit \"Start\". After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoCLR image will run. This time and if all goes as expected, there will be no LED blinking. You can check if the board is properly running nanoFramework by looking into the Device Explorer window in VS. Uploading the firmware to the board using the .dfu file This is the second method that can be used to flash the board. To manually flash firmware using ST DFUSE tools, get a copy of ST DFUSE tools . Install the DFUSE tools. Put your device in bootloader mode. This can be accomplished by pressing a certain combination of buttons. It depends on the particular hardware that you are using. Step one Start the STDFU Tester application. Select the \"Protocol\" tab. Press the \"Create from Map\" button. Select the \"Erase\" radio button option. Press the \"Go\" button. Wait for the erase process to complete. Step two Start the DFUSE Demo Application Locate the .dfu file located in the device firmware update .zip file. Note: If the .dfu file does not exist in the .zip file. It can be created following the instructions here . Click the \"Choose\" button then the \"Update\" button. Toggle the devices power. Coding a 'Hello World' application Now you have everything that you need to start coding your first application. Let's go for a good old 'Hello World' in micro-controller mode, which is blinking a LED, shall we? Go back to VS and click File > New > Project. Make sure you have selected 'Framework 4.6 or above' and choose nanoFramework, on the left hand side tree view. Choose the 'Blank Application' template and a location of your choosing were the project files will be saved. Name your project and hit OK. The program file will be automatically opened for you. We'll code a very simple application that enters an infinite loop and turns on and off an LED. We'll skip the details because that's not the aim of this guide. Let's just grab the code from the nanoFramework samples repo here . Make sure that the correct GPIO pin is being used. That's the line below the comment mentioning the STM32F746 NUCLEO board. Because GPIO is being used we need to pull that class library and a reference to it in our project. The class libraries are distributed through NuGet. To add this class, right click on 'References' in the Solution Explorer and click 'Manage NuGet Packages'. On the search box type 'nanoFramework'. Make sure you have the preview checkbox ticked. Find the Windows.Devices.Gpio package and click \"Install\". After the license confirmation box, the package will be downloaded and a reference to it will be added. You'll notice that you no longer have the unknown references hints in VS. Click \"Build Solution\" from the Build menu. A success message shows in the Build window. We are almost there. Go into the Device Explorer window and click on the nanoFramework device showing there. Make sure the connection is OK by hitting the \"Ping\" button. On success, a message shows on the output window. Let's deploy the application to the board. In order to do that, right click on the Project name and choose \"Deploy\". You'll see the feedback of the several operations that are running on the background in the Output Window. After a successful deployment you need to reset the target and your 'Hello World' blinky application will start running and, voilá , the LED starts blinking! If you want, instead of \"just\" deploying the application to the target you can choose to start a debug session. To do that hit F5 (as usual) in Visual Studio and watch it run. Wrapping up Congratulations! That's your first nanoFramework C# application executing right there on the target board. How awesome is that?! And this is it for the getting started guide. You've went through the steps required to install Visual Studio, the nanoFramework extension and the ST-LINK Utility. You've also learned how to upload nanoFramework firmware images into a target board. And last, but not the least: how to code a simple 'Hello World' C# application and deploy it to a target board. Check out other guides and tutorials. You may also want to join our Discord channel , where you'll find a supportive community to discuss your ideas and help you in case you get stuck on something."

You should use the develop branch for mainstream development or the develop-network branch to work with the networking features which is currently a work in progress. A guide to making contributions is provided here Setting up the build environment for ESP32 After cloning the repo, you need to setup the build environment. You can use the power shell script or follow the step-by-step instructions. Automated Install of the build environment for ESP32 The following power shell script is not signed. Run Power Shell as an Administrator and run set-executionpolicy remotesigned to enable execution of the non-signed script. On Windows, one may use the .\\install-esp32-tools.ps1 Power Shell script located in the repository install-scripts folder to download the ESP32 IDF Source, toolchain, prebuilt libraries, OpenOCD (for JTAG debugging) and Ninja Zips. You may need to use Run as Administrator for power shell to permit installing modules to unzip the downloaded archives. The script will download the zips into the repository zips folder and extract them into sub-folders of the main ESP32 tool folder: C:\\Esp32_Tools Open Power Shell in the install-scripts folder of the repository and run the script specifying the COM port the ESP32 flash programming utility will use (The COM port is easily changed later. If it is not specified, manually edit tasks.json and change instances of <COMPORT> to the required port before flashing the ESP32 nanoCLR firmware.) Example Power Shell command line: .\\install-esp32-tools.ps1 -COMPORT COM19 You can force the environment variables to be updated by adding -Force to the command line. The script will create the following sub-folders (see manual install below and appveyor.yml) C:\\Esp32_Tools\\1.22.0-80 C:\\Esp32_Tools\\esp-idf-v3.1 C:\\Esp32_Tools\\libs-v3.1 C:\\Esp32_Tools\\ninja C:\\Esp32_Tools\\openocd-esp32 The following Environment Variables will be created for the current Windows User.

To save time on building the nanoCLR and to avoid having to create a CMakeLists.txt project for the ESP32 IDF files, the ESP32 IDF libraries are prebuilt using the Esp32 Msys32 environment then used for linking in the CMake build of nanoCLR. This has already been done and the libraries can be just be downloaded. Create a directory such as the following: C:\\Esp32_Tools C:\\Esp32_Tools\\libs-v3.1 Download the pre-built libs zip from here and extract it into C:\\Esp32_Tools\\libs-v3.1 . Download the v3.1 IDF source zip file from here and extract it into C:\\Esp32_Tools so you get C:\\ESP32_Tools\\esp-idf-v3.1\\components etc. Download the Esp32 toolchain from here and extract it into C:\\Esp32_Tools\\1.22.0.80 so you get C:\\Esp32_Tools\\1.22.0.80\\xtensa-esp32-elf .

For flashing the nanoCLR into the ESP32 or to erase the flash of the ESP32 you will need a tasks.json file. You can manually copy the template ( tasks.TEMPLATE-ESP32.json ) and then adjust the COM port and the varios paths with place holders ( !!mind the forward slashes!! ) to your needs. The Power Shell script .\\install-esp32-tools.ps1 will adjust the file for you if you used it. Use the parameter '-C COM6' to select COM6 for flashing the ESP32 DevKitC. { \"version\": \"2.0.0\", \"tasks\": [ { \"taskName\": \"Flash nanoCLR <COMPORT>\", \"type\": \"shell\", \"command\": \"python <absolute-path-to-the-IDF-folder-mind-the-forward-slashes>/components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port \\\"<COMPORT>\\\" --baud 460800 --before \\\"default_reset\\\" --after \\\"hard_reset\\\" write_flash -z --flash_mode \\\"dio\\\" --flash_freq \\\"40m\\\" --flash_size detect 0x1000 <absolute-path-to-the-bootloader-folder-mind-the-forward-slashes>/bootloader.bin 0x10000 <path-to-nanoFramework-build-directory-mind-the-forward-slashes>/nanoCLR.bin 0x8000 <path-to-nanoFramework-build-directory-mind-the-forward-slashes>/partitions_4mb.bin\", \"presentation\": { \"reveal\": \"always\", \"panel\": \"shared\" }, \"problemMatcher\": [] }, { \"taskName\": \"Erase flash <COMPORT>\", \"type\": \"shell\", \"command\": \"python <absolute-path-to-the-IDF-folder-mind-the-forward-slashes>/components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py --chip esp32 --port \\\"<COMPORT>\\\" --baud 460800 --before \\\"default_reset\\\" --after \\\"hard_reset\\\" erase_flash\", \"presentation\": { \"reveal\": \"always\", \"panel\": \"shared\" }, \"problemMatcher\": [] } ] } Build nanoCLR Launch Visual Studio and from the File menu, select Open Folder and browse to the repo folder. VSCode will prompt asking \"Would you like to configure this project?\". Ignore the prompt as you need to select the build variant first. To enter a command into Visual Studio Code use the key combination Ctrl+Shift+P. Click on CMake in the Status bar or enter the command CMake: Set build variant and set it to the Debug + NanoCLR build type. If it also asks for a kit select ESP32 Tools Wait for CMake to process the files and build the CMake cache. This can take a while the first time. Press F7, or click on Build in the Status bar or enter the command CMake: Build If you get no error you will have in the build directory the files nanoCLR.bin and partitions_4mb.bin . The third file that gets flashed into the ESP32 is the bootloader.bin which will be located here C:/ESP32_Tools/libs-v3.1/bootloader.bin if the automated install script is used. Note: If there are errors during the build process it is possible to end up with a partial build in the build folder, and the CMake/Ninja build process declaring a successful build despite the .bin targets not being created, and a CMake clean not helping. In this case deleting the contents of the build folder should allow the build to complete once you resolve the issues that cause the original failure. Flash nanoCLR into ESP32 Connect your development board to the computer port that you've setup in tasks.json . Bring your board into download mode by holding down the GPIO0 pin to GND or holding down the respective button during power up. In Visual Studio Code enter the command Tasks: Run task and if you flash the board for the first time Erase flash and then Flash nanoCLR Start with a 'Hello World' C# application Watch the video tutorial here and follow the step that should be done in Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition. Skip the steps that describing uploading the nanoCLR into the STM32 Nucleo board. Debugging nanoCLR If you want to debug the nanoCLR on the ESP32 chip you can use the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD-H JTAG debugging adapter. The following setup is specific for the Olimex ARM-USB-OCD-H but you can use other configuration files to get it working with other JTAG adapters. Create a ./.vscode/launch.json from /.vscode/launch.TEMPLATE-ESP32.json . Edit the file and adjust the absolute path <absolute-path-to-the-build-folder-mind-the-forward-slashes> to the build folder ( !!mind the forward slashes!! ) to your needs. The Power Shell script .\\install-esp32-tools.ps1 will adjust the file for you. The following example assumes the OpenOCD tool was installed in the default location. Adjust the path as required if you used a custom install path to OpenOCD. { \"version\": \"0.2.0\", \"configurations\": [ { \"name\": \"ESP32 nanoCLR - OLimex OCD-H\", \"type\": \"cppdbg\", \"request\": \"launch\", \"MIMode\": \"gdb\", \"miDebuggerPath\": \"C:/ESP32_Tools/1.22.0-80/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gdb.exe\", \"stopAtEntry\":true, \"program\": \"<absolute-path-to-the-build-folder-mind-the-forward-slashes>/targets/FreeRTOS/ESP32_DevKitC/nanoCLR.elf\", \"setupCommands\": [ {\"text\": \"set logging on\"}, {\"text\": \"target extended-remote localhost:3333\"}, {\"text\": \"file <absolute-path-to-the-build-folder-mind-the-forward-slashes>/nanoCLR.elf\"}, {\"text\": \"monitor reset halt\"}, {\"text\": \"thb app_main\"}, {\"text\": \"x $a1=0\"} ], \"launchCompleteCommand\": \"exec-run\", \"debugServerPath\": \"C:/Esp32_Tools/openocd-esp32/bin/openocd.exe\", \"debugServerArgs\": \"-s \\\"C:/Esp32_Tools/openocd-esp32/share/openocd/scripts/\\\" -f interface/ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-ocd-h.cfg -f target/esp32.cfg -c \\\"adapter_khz 3000\\\" \" , \"serverStarted\": \"Info : .*Tensilica.*0x1.\", \"filterStderr\": true, \"externalConsole\": true, \"cwd\": \"${cwd}\", \"logging\": { \"trace\": true, \"traceResponse\": true, \"engineLogging\": true, \"programOutput\": true, \"exceptions\": true, \"moduleLoad\": true } } ] } You can now debug nanoCLR on the ESP32 by pressing F5 in Visual Studio Code. Notes on JTAG debugging on ESP32 The JTAG connections on ESP32 DEVKITC are: TDI -> GPIO12 TCK -> GPIO13 TMS -> GPIO14 TDO -> GPIO15 TRST -> EN / RST (Reset) GND -> GND See Gojimmypi for description of JTAG connections here . If flashing nanoCLR via a COM port (default), then be aware that you need to disconnect the JTAG to avoid it preventing the bootloader from running, and therefore being unable to reprogram the ESP23. e.g. if you see the following pattern repeating, unplug the USB-OCD-H, and then the programming will proceed. esptool.py v2.1 Connecting........_____....._____... The Esp32 only has 2 hardware breakpoints. As code is dynamically loaded unless the method has an IRAM_ATTR attribute any breakpoints set up at the start will cause an error when you try to debug (Unable to set breakpoint). When launched the debugger will normally stop at the main task. Its not possible to set a break point on code that is not yet loaded so either step down to a point that it is loaded or temporarily set the method with the IRAM_ATTR attribute. For more information on JTAG debugging see Espressif documentation ."

    "keywords": "Working with Visual Studio extension I have a Solution with several class library projects that are referenced in the application project. After a few debug sessions VS complains that it can't access one of them because the file is locked by another process. This occurs because the debugger or de deployment provider have locked that DLL on a previous debug session. To prevent this from happening, you have to open the \"Configuration Manager\" dialog for the Solution and un-check the \"Deploy\" option for all projects except the executable. To remove the lock on that file open a PowerShell console and execute the following command, being NNNN the process number that shows at the very end of the VS message: Stop-Process -id NNNNN . When I build a project/solutions it fails with an error NFMDP: Error 0x81010009 . What is this? This happens when you are using a C# feature that is not currently supported by nanoFramework. The most common cases are generics or a complicated Linq expression. There is currently no way to point you exactly where the issue is. The best suggestion is to build often so you can spot this as early as possible. It can also help if you comment the code that you've added recently and start uncomment as you run the build. This way you'll have a general guidance on where the root cause could be. When deploying an application I get a message like Couldn't find a valid native assembly required by... complaining that it can't find a native assembly. What can I do to fix this? This occurs when you are deploying a project that is referencing one (or more) libraries for which the target image doesn't have support or are of a different version. Make sure you have your NuGet updated and that the target device is flashed with the appropriate image. It could be that you are referencing preview versions of the NuGet packages but the target device is flashed with an older stable image and is \"behind\"."

There are available several different versions including: ESP32-WROOM-32, ESP32-WROOM-32D, ESP32-WROOM-32U, ESP32-SOLO-1, ESP32-WROVER-B, ESP32-WROVER-IB, etc. The current ESP32 Dev Kit C image that we provide works on all ESP32 boards that use the ESP32-Wroom-32x or ESP32-WROVER modules. The ESP32-WROVER modules also have PSRAM which we currently don't support but will in the future. The SOLO modules have only one core which currently won't work as we start the nanoCLR on the 2nd core. Can I use Smart Config to configure my ESP32 devices? Yes you can! The Smart Config is automatically started when the device is booted and there is no wireless SSID set up. i.e. When the device is first flashed. To configure the device use one of the Smart Config apps on your phone such as :- the ESP8266 SmartConfig, DHC smartConfig apps on Android and EspressiF ESpTouch on IOS. Connect phone to Wifi to the Access point, run Smart Config application which will prompt you for the AP password. This will then send the details to the device. The device saves the details and connects to the AP point. When connected it confirms the connection back to the Phone. When the device is next rebooted the device automatically connects to AP as the WiFi details have been saved. For more information see here . In your application you can wait for the network to be configured/connected by waiting for the IP to be set. static void WaitIP() { Console.WriteLine(\"Wait for IP\"); while (true) { NetworkInterface ni = NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces()[0]; if (ni.IPv4Address != null && ni.IPv4Address.Length > 0) { if (ni.IPv4Address[0] != '0') { Console.WriteLine(\"Have IP \" + ni.IPv4Address); break; } } Thread.Sleep(1000); } }"

I have a Solution that targets both nanoFramework and standard .NET and would like to share/reuse code in both platforms. I know I can't reference assemblies from one into the other. How can I accomplish this? Your best option is to use a shared project to hold the common code. Put there the classes that are to be used in both platforms. You can go all the way into this reusability by using compiler constants, compiler defines and even partial classes. For a small example on this check the ToString sample on our samples repo. It's using this technic to share code between a nanoFramework app and a .NET console app. I need to debug something in a class library how can I easily replace the NuGet reference with the real project? This can be easily accomplished by using a handy Visual Studio extension called NuGet Reference Switcher . Add the class library project to your solution and using that tool switch the NuGet package reference to the recently added project. After debugging you can switch back to the NuGet reference."

You can then call the Address method to retrieve the local IPAddress , and the Port method to retrieve the local port number. The LocalEndPoint property is usually set after you make a call to the Bind(EndPoint) method. If you allow the system to assign your socket's local IP address and port number, the LocalEndPoint property will be set after the first I/O operation. For connection-oriented protocols, the first I/O operation would be a call to the Connect or Accept method. For connectionless protocols, the first I/O operation would be any of the send or receive calls. | Improve this Doc View Source ReceiveTimeout Gets or sets a value that specifies the amount of time after which a synchronous Receive(Byte[]) call will time out. Declaration public int ReceiveTimeout { get; set; } Property Value Type Description Int32 The time-out value, in milliseconds. The default value is 0, which indicates an infinite time-out period. Specifying -1 also indicates an infinite time-out period. Remarks This option applies to synchronous Receive(Byte[]) calls only. If the time-out period is exceeded, the Receive(Byte[]) method will throw a SocketException . | Improve this Doc View Source RemoteEndPoint Gets the remote endpoint. Declaration public EndPoint RemoteEndPoint { get; } Property Value Type Description EndPoint The EndPoint with which the Socket is communicating. Remarks If you are using a connection-oriented protocol, the RemoteEndPoint property gets the EndPoint that contains the remote IP address and port number to which the Socket is connected. If you are using a connectionless protocol, RemoteEndPoint contains the default remote IP address and port number with which the Socket will communicate. You must cast this EndPoint to an IPEndPoint before retrieving any information. You can then call the Address method to retrieve the remote IPAddress , and the Port method to retrieve the remote port number. The RemoteEndPoint is set after a call to either Accept() or Connect(EndPoint) . If you try to access this property earlier, RemoteEndPoint will throw a SocketException . If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code. After you have obtained this code, refer to the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in the MSDN library for a detailed description of the error. | Improve this Doc View Source SendTimeout Gets or sets a value that specifies the amount of time after which a synchronous Send(Byte[]) call will time out. Declaration public int SendTimeout { get; set; } Property Value Type Description Int32 The time-out value, in milliseconds. If you set the property with a value between 1 and 499, the value will be changed to 500. The default value is 0, which indicates an infinite time-out period. Specifying -1 also indicates an infinite time-out period. Remarks This option applies to synchronous Send(Byte[]) calls only. If the time-out period is exceeded, the Send(Byte[]) method will throw a SocketException . Methods | Improve this Doc View Source Accept() Creates a new Socket for a newly created connection. Declaration public Socket Accept() Returns Type Description Socket A Socket for a newly created connection. Remarks Accept synchronously extracts the first pending connection request from the connection request queue of the listening socket, and then creates and returns a new Socket . You cannot use this returned Socket to accept any additional connections from the connection queue. However, you can call the RemoteEndPoint method of the returned Socket to identify the remote host's network address and port number. Before calling the Accept method, you must first call the Listen method to listen for and queue incoming connection requests. | Improve this Doc View Source Bind(EndPoint) Associates a Socket with a local endpoint. Declaration public void Bind(EndPoint localEP) Parameters Type Name Description EndPoint localEP The local EndPoint to associate with the Socket . Remarks Use the Bind method if you need to use a specific local endpoint. You must call Bind before you can call the Listen(Int32) method. You do not need to call Bind before using the Connect(EndPoint) method unless you need to use a specific local endpoint. You can use the Bind method on both connectionless and connection-oriented protocols. Before calling Bind, you must first create the local IPEndPoint from which you intend to communicate data. If you do not care which local address is assigned, you can create an IPEndPoint using Any as the address parameter, and the underlying service provider will assign the most appropriate network address. This might help simplify your application if you have multiple network interfaces. If you do not care which local port is used, you can create an IPEndPoint using 0 for the port number. In this case, the service provider will assign an available port number between 1024 and 5000. If you use the above approach, you can discover what local network address and port number has been assigned by calling the LocalEndPoint . If you are using a connection-oriented protocol, LocalEndPoint will not return the locally assigned network address until after you have made a call to the Connect(EndPoint) method. If you are using a connectionless protocol, you will not have access to this information until you have completed a send or receive. If you intend to receive multicast datagrams, you must call the Bind method with a multicast port number. You must call the Bind method if you intend to receive connectionless datagrams using the ReceiveFrom method. | Improve this Doc View Source Close() Closes the Socket connection and releases all associated resources. Declaration public void Close() Remarks The Close method closes the remote host connection and releases all managed and unmanaged resources associated with the Socket. Upon closing, the Connected property is set to false. | Improve this Doc View Source Connect(EndPoint) Establishes a connection to a remote host. Declaration public void Connect(EndPoint remoteEP) Parameters Type Name Description EndPoint remoteEP An EndPoint that represents the remote device. Remarks If you are using a connection-oriented protocol such as TCP, the Connect method synchronously establishes a network connection between LocalEndPoint and the specified remote endpoint. If you are using a connectionless protocol, Connect establishes a default remote host. After you call Connect, you can send data to the remote device with the Send(Byte[]) method, or receive data from the remote device with the Receive(Byte[]) method. If you are using a connectionless protocol such as UDP, you do not have to call Connect before sending and receiving data. You can use SendTo(Byte[], EndPoint) and ReceiveFrom(Byte[], Int32, Int32, SocketFlags, ref EndPoint) to synchronously communicate with a remote host. If you do call Connect, any datagrams that arrive from an address other than the specified default will be discarded. If you want to set your default remote host to a broadcast address, you must first call the SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName, Boolean) method and set the socket option to Broadcast , or Connect will throw a SocketException. If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code. After you have obtained this code, refer to the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in the MSDN library for a detailed description of the error. If you are using a connection-oriented protocol and did not call Bind before calling Connect, the underlying service provider will assign the local network address and port number. If you are using a connectionless protocol, the service provider will not assign a local network address and port number until you complete a send or receive operation. If you want to change the default remote host, call Connect again with the desired endpoint. | Improve this Doc View Source Dispose(Boolean) Releases the unmanaged resources used by the Socket , and optionally disposes of the managed resources. Declaration protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing) Parameters Type Name Description Boolean disposing true to release both managed and unmanaged resources; false to releases only unmanaged resources. Remarks This method is called by the public Dispose() method and the Finalize() method. Dispose() invokes the protected Dispose(Boolean) method with the disposing parameter set to true. Finalize() invokes Dispose with disposing set to false. When the disposing parameter is true, this method releases all resources held by any managed objects that this Socket references. This method invokes the Dispose() method of each referenced object. | Improve this Doc View Source Finalize() Deconstructor Declaration protected void Finalize() | Improve this Doc View Source GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName) Returns the value of a Socket option.

When the optionName parameter is set to Linger the return value is an instance of the LingerOption class. When optionName is set to AddMembership or DropMembership , the return value is an instance of the MulticastOption class. When optionName is any other value, the return value is an integer. Remarks Socket options determine the behavior of the current Socket . Use this overload to get the Linger , AddMembership , and DropMembership options. For the Linger option, use Socket for the optionLevel parameter. For AddMembership and DropMembership , use IP . If you want to set the value of any of the options listed above, use the SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName, Int32) method. | Improve this Doc View Source GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName, Byte[]) Returns the specified Socket option setting, represented as a byte array. Declaration public void GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel optionLevel, SocketOptionName optionName, byte[] val) Parameters Type Name Description SocketOptionLevel optionLevel One of the SocketOptionLevel values. SocketOptionName optionName One of the SocketOptionName values. Byte [] val An array of type Byte that is to receive the option setting. Remarks Socket options determine the behavior of the current Socket . Upon successful completion of this method, the array specified by the val parameter contains the value of the specified Socket option. When the length of the val array is smaller than the number of bytes required to store the value of the specified Socket option, GetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel, SocketOptionName) will throw a SocketException. If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code. After you have obtained this code, refer to the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in the MSDN library for a detailed description of the error. Use this overload for any sockets that are represented by Boolean values or integers. | Improve this Doc View Source Listen(Int32) Places a Socket in a listening state. Declaration public void Listen(int backlog) Parameters Type Name Description Int32 backlog The maximum length of the pending connections queue. Remarks Listen causes a connection-oriented Socket to listen for incoming connection attempts. The backlog parameter specifies the number of incoming connections that can be queued for acceptance. To determine the maximum number of connections you can specify, retrieve the MaxConnections value. Listen does not block. If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code. After you have obtained this code, refer to the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in the MSDN library for a detailed description of the error. Use Accept() or BeginAccept to accept a connection from the queue. You must call the Bind(EndPoint) method before calling Listen, or Listen will throw a SocketException . | Improve this Doc View Source Poll(Int32, SelectMode) Determines the status of the Socket . Declaration public bool Poll(int microSeconds, SelectMode mode) Parameters Type Name Description Int32 microSeconds The time to wait for a response, in microseconds. SelectMode mode One of the SelectMode values. Returns Type Description Boolean The status of the Socket based on the polling mode value passed in the mode parameter. SelectRead SelectWrite SelectError true if Listen has been called and a connection is pending; -or- true if data is available for reading; -or- true if the connection has been closed, reset, or terminated; otherwise, returns false. true , if processing a Connect, and the connection has succeeded; -or- true if data can be sent; otherwise, returns false. true if processing a Connect(EndPoint) that does not block, and the connection has failed; -or- true if OutOfBandInline is not set and out-of-band data is available; otherwise, returns false. Remarks The Poll method will check the state of the Socket . Specify SelectRead for the selectMode parameter to determine if the Socket is readable. Specify SelectWrite to determine if the Socket is writable. Use SelectError to detect an error condition. Poll will block execution until the specified time period, measured in microseconds, elapses. Set the microSeconds parameter to a negative integer if you would like to wait indefinitely for a response. If you want to check the status of multiple sockets, you might prefer to use the Select method. If you receive a SocketException , use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code.

Declaration public int Receive(byte[] buffer) Parameters Type Name Description Byte [] buffer An array of type Byte that is the storage location for the received data. Returns Type Description Int32 The number of bytes received. Remarks The Receive(Byte[]) method reads data into the buffer parameter and returns the number of bytes successfully read. You can call Receive(Byte[]) from both connection-oriented and connectionless sockets. This overload only requires you to provide a receive buffer. The buffer offset defaults to 0, the size defaults to the length of the buffer parameter, and the SocketFlags value defaults to None . If no data is available for reading, the Receive(Byte[]) method will block until data is available, unless a time-out value was set by using ReceiveTimeout .

Declaration public int Send(byte[] buffer) Parameters Type Name Description Byte [] buffer An array of type Byte that contains the data to be sent Returns Type Description Int32 The number of bytes sent to the Socket . Remarks Send(Byte[]) synchronously sends data to the remote host specified in the Connect(EndPoint) or Accept() method and returns the number of bytes successfully sent. Send(Byte[]) can be used for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols. This overload requires a buffer that contains the data you want to send. The SocketFlags value defaults to 0, the buffer offset defaults to 0, and the number of bytes to send defaults to the size of the buffer. If you are using a connectionless protocol, you must call Connect(EndPoint) before calling this method, or will throw a SocketException . If you are using a connection-oriented protocol, you must either use Connect(EndPoint) to establish a remote host connection, or use Accept() to accept an incoming connection. If you are using a connectionless protocol and plan to send data to several different hosts, you should use the SendTo(Byte[], EndPoint) method. If you do not use the SendTo method, you will have to call Connect before each call to Send. You can use SendTo even after you have established a default remote host with Connect. You can also change the default remote host prior to calling Send by making another call to Connect. If you are using a connection-oriented protocol, will block until all of the bytes in the buffer are sent, unless a time-out was set by using SendTimeout . If the time-out value was exceeded, the call will throw a SocketException . In nonblocking mode, Send may complete successfully even if it sends less than the number of bytes in the buffer. It is your application's responsibility to keep track of the number of bytes sent and to retry the operation until the application sends the bytes in the buffer. There is also no guarantee that the data you send will appear on the network immediately. To increase network efficiency, the underlying system may delay transmission until a significant amount of outgoing data is collected. A successful completion of the Send(Byte[]) method means that the underlying system has had room to buffer your data for a network send. important If you receive a SocketException, use the ErrorCode property to obtain the specific error code. After you have obtained this code, refer to the Windows Sockets version 2 API error code documentation in the MSDN library for a detailed description of the error. important The successful completion of a send does not indicate that the data was successfully delivered.

    "keywords": "Enum DebuggableAttribute.DebuggingModes Specifies the debugging mode for the just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Namespace : System.Diagnostics Assembly : mscorlib.dll Syntax public enum DebuggingModes Fields Name Description Default Instructs the just-in-time (JIT) compiler to use its default behavior, which includes enabling optimizations, disabling Edit and Continue support, and using symbol store sequence points if present. Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, JIT tracking information, the Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) offset to the native-code offset within a method, is always generated. DisableOptimizations Disable optimizations performed by the compiler to make your output file smaller, faster, and more efficient. Optimizations result in code rearrangement in the output file, which can make debugging difficult. Typically optimization should be disabled while debugging. In versions 2.0 or later, combine this value with Default (Default | DisableOptimizations) to enable JIT tracking and disable optimizations. EnableEditAndContinue Enable edit and continue. Edit and continue enables you to make changes to your source code while your program is in break mode. The ability to edit and continue is compiler dependent. IgnoreSymbolStoreSequencePoints Use the implicit MSIL sequence points, not the program database (PDB) sequence points. The symbolic information normally includes at least one Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) offset for each source line. When the just-in-time (JIT) compiler is about to compile a method, it asks the profiling services for a list of MSIL offsets that should be preserved. These MSIL offsets are called sequence points. None Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, JIT tracking information is always generated, and this flag has the same effect as Default, except that it sets the DebuggableAttribute.IsJITTrackingEnabled property to false. However, because JIT tracking is always enabled, the property value is ignored in version 2.0 or later. Note that, unlike the None flag, the None flag cannot be used to disable JIT optimizations."

It is not possible to call a type initializer. This flag is passed to an InvokeMember method to invoke a constructor. DeclaredOnly Specifies that only members declared at the level of the supplied type's hierarchy should be considered. Inherited members are not considered. Default Specifies that no binding flags are defined. ExactBinding Specifies that types of the supplied arguments must exactly match the types of the corresponding formal parameters. Reflection throws an exception if the caller supplies a non-null Binder object, since that implies that the caller is supplying BindToXXX implementations that will pick the appropriate method.

The SocketType enumeration provides several options for defining the type of Socket that you intend to open. Fields Name Description Dgram Supports datagrams, which are connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed (typically small) maximum length. Messages might be lost or duplicated and might arrive out of order. A Socket of type Dgram requires no connection prior to sending and receiving data, and can communicate with multiple peers. Dgram uses the Datagram Protocol (Udp) and the InterNetworkAddressFamily. Raw Supports access to the underlying transport protocol. Using the SocketTypeRaw, you can communicate using protocols like Internet Control Message Protocol (Icmp) and Internet Group Management Protocol (Igmp). Your application must provide a complete IP header when sending. Received datagrams return with the IP header and options intact. Rdm Supports connectionless, message-oriented, reliably delivered messages, and preserves message boundaries in data. Rdm (Reliably Delivered Messages) messages arrive unduplicated and in order. Furthermore, the sender is notified if messages are lost. If you initialize a Socket using Rdm, you do not require a remote host connection before sending and receiving data. With Rdm, you can communicate with multiple peers. Seqpacket Provides connection-oriented and reliable two-way transfer of ordered byte streams across a network. Seqpacket does not duplicate data, and it preserves boundaries within the data stream. A Socket of type Seqpacket communicates with a single peer and requires a remote host connection before communication can begin. Stream Supports reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams without the duplication of data and without preservation of boundaries. A Socket of this type communicates with a single peer and requires a remote host connection before communication can begin. Stream uses the Transmission Control Protocol (Tcp) ProtocolType and the InterNetworkAddressFamily. Unknown Specifies an unknown Socket type."

IpTimeToLive IP time to live. KeepAlive Send keep-alives. Linger Linger on close if unsent data is present. MaxConnections Maximum queue length that can be specified by Listen(Int32) . MulticastInterface IP multicast interface. - Additional comments by mbolien: multicast interface You provide it with an SOCKADDR_IN, and that tells the system that it should receive multicast messages on that interface (if you have more than one interface). Binding the socket is not sufficient, since if the Ethernet hardware isnt set up to grab the multicast packets, it wont do good to bind the socket. Kinda like raw sockets. Unless you put the Ethernet card in promiscuous mode, youll only get stuff sent to and from your machine. MulticastLoopback IP Multicast loopback. MulticastTimeToLive IP multicast time to live. NoChecksum Send UDP datagrams with checksum set to zero. NoDelay Disables the Nagle algorithm for send coalescing. OutOfBandInline Receives out-of-band data in the normal data stream. PacketInformation Receive packet information for ipv4. ReceiveBuffer Send low water mark. ReceiveLowWater Receive low water mark. ReceiveTimeout Receive timeout. ReuseAddress Allows the socket to be bound to an address that is already in use. SendBuffer Specifies the total per-socket buffer space reserved for sends. This is unrelated to the maximum message size or the size of a TCP window. SendLowWater Specifies the total per-socket buffer space reserved for receives. This is unrelated to the maximum message size or the size of a TCP window. SendTimeout Send timeout. Type Get socket type. TypeOfService IP type of service and preced. UnblockSource Unblock IP group/source. UpdateAcceptContext Updates an accepted socket's properties by using those of an existing socket.
