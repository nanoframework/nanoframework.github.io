# .NET **nanoFramework** APIs

Our APIs try to follow, as closely as possible, the ones from UWP. The main goal is to potentiate code reuse, existing code samples for Core IoT and even Desktop.
This is a work in progress so do check back often for updates.

If you find any bugs in documentation we appreciate if you let us know or even better submit a PR with the correction.

Happy coding with .NET **nanoFramework**!
