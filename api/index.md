# .NET **nanoFramework** APIs

Our APIs try to follow, as closely as possible, the ones from [.NET IoT](https://github.com/dotnet/iot). The main goal is to potentiate code reuse, existing code samples for .NET IoT and even Desktop.
This is a work in progress so do check back often for updates.

If you find any bugs in documentation we appreciate if you let us know or even better submit a PR with the correction.

Happy coding with .NET **nanoFramework**!
