      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Angle.html">Angle</a></h4>
      <section><p>In geometry, an angle is the figure formed by two rays, called the sides of the angle, sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Duration.html">Duration</a></h4>
      <section><p>Time is a dimension in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.ElectricCurrent.html">ElectricCurrent</a></h4>
      <section><p>An electric current is a flow of electric charge. In electric circuits this charge is often carried by moving electrons in a wire. It can also be carried by ions in an electrolyte, or by both ions and electrons such as in a plasma.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.ElectricPotential.html">ElectricPotential</a></h4>
      <section><p>In classical electromagnetism, the electric potential (a scalar quantity denoted by Φ, ΦE or V and also called the electric field potential or the electrostatic potential) at a point is the amount of electric potential energy that a unitary point charge would have when located at that point.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.ElectricResistance.html">ElectricResistance</a></h4>
      <section><p>The electrical resistance of an electrical conductor is the opposition to the passage of an electric current through that conductor.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Frequency.html">Frequency</a></h4>
      <section><p>The number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Illuminance.html">Illuminance</a></h4>
      <section><p>In photometry, illuminance is the total luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Length.html">Length</a></h4>
      <section><p>Many different units of length have been used around the world. The main units in modern use are U.S. customary units in the United States and the Metric system elsewhere. British Imperial units are still used for some purposes in the United Kingdom and some other countries. The metric system is sub-divided into SI and non-SI units.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Mass.html">Mass</a></h4>
      <section><p>In physics, mass (from Greek μᾶζα &quot;barley cake, lump [of dough]&quot;) is a property of a physical system or body, giving rise to the phenomena of the body's resistance to being accelerated by a force and the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction with other bodies. Instruments such as mass balances or scales use those phenomena to measure mass. The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.MassConcentration.html">MassConcentration</a></h4>
      <section><p>In chemistry, the mass concentration ρi (or γi) is defined as the mass of a constituent mi divided by the volume of the mixture V</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Power.html">Power</a></h4>
      <section><p>In physics, power is the rate of doing work. It is equivalent to an amount of energy consumed per unit time.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Pressure.html">Pressure</a></h4>
      <section><p>Pressure (symbol: P or p) is the ratio of force to the area over which that force is distributed. Pressure is force per unit area applied in a direction perpendicular to the surface of an object. Gauge pressure (also spelled gage pressure)[a] is the pressure relative to the local atmospheric or ambient pressure. Pressure is measured in any unit of force divided by any unit of area. The SI unit of pressure is the newton per square metre, which is called the pascal (Pa) after the seventeenth-century philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal. A pressure of 1 Pa is small; it approximately equals the pressure exerted by a dollar bill resting flat on a table. Everyday pressures are often stated in kilopascals (1 kPa = 1000 Pa).</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Ratio.html">Ratio</a></h4>
      <section><p>In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers of the same kind (e.g., objects, persons, students, spoonfuls, units of whatever identical dimension), usually expressed as &quot;a to b&quot; or a:b, sometimes expressed arithmetically as a dimensionless quotient of the two that explicitly indicates how many times the first number contains the second (not necessarily an integer).</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.RelativeHumidity.html">RelativeHumidity</a></h4>
      <section><p>Relative humidity is a ratio of the actual water vapor present in the air to the maximum water vapor in the air at the given temperature.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.Temperature.html">Temperature</a></h4>
      <section><p>A temperature is a numerical measure of hot or cold. Its measurement is by detection of heat radiation or particle velocity or kinetic energy, or by the bulk behavior of a thermometric material. It may be calibrated in any of various temperature scales, Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, etc. The fundamental physical definition of temperature is provided by thermodynamics.</p>
</section>
      <h4><a class="xref" href="UnitsNet.VolumeConcentration.html">VolumeConcentration</a></h4>
      <section><p>The volume concentration (not to be confused with volume fraction) is defined as the volume of a constituent divided by the total volume of the mixture.</p>
